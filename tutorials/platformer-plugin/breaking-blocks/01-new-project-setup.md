# New Project Setup

### Introduction

We'll begin this tutorial with an empty project. Mine will be called BreakingBlocksProject.

### New Project Wizard

The New Project Wizard can help us get a quick project set up. We will leave most of the options to their default, but we will change the following:

#### Player Entity

* Change **What kind of control will the player have?** to **Platformer**
* Uncheck **Add Sprite to Player Entity** unless you intend to add graphics to your Player entity. This tutorial will not cover how to add graphics to the Player entity.

#### Levels

* Change **Number of levels to create** to **1**. We will only have one level in this game

### Conclusion

Now our project is ready to go and we can start adding our level.
