# Tweener

### Introduction

The Tweener object stores information about a tween. It is created whenever the [Tween](gluevault-component-pages-advanced-interpolation-plugin-tween-function.md) extension method is called, or it can be manually created and added to the [TweenerManager](tweenermanager.md).
