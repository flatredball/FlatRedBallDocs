# Play

### Introduction

The Play method can be used to play a [SoundEffect](../../../../frb/docs/index.php), optionally specifying the volume to play at. The Play method performs the following additional logic:

* It only plays the [SoundEffect](../../../../frb/docs/index.php) if [AreSoundEffectsEnabled](../../../../frb/docs/index.php) is true.
* It checks if the [SoundEffect](../../../../frb/docs/index.php) has already been played this frame, preventing the same [SoundEffect](../../../../frb/docs/index.php) from playing twice in one frame. This behavior depends on the value of [SoundEffectPlayingBehavior](../../../../frb/docs/index.php).
* It increments [NumberOfSoundEffectPlays](../../../../frb/docs/index.php) which can be used to measure how many times sound effects have played.
* It checks if the argument [SoundEffect](../../../../frb/docs/index.php) has been disposed (debug only) and throws an informative exception if so.

### Code Examples

The following assumes that Explosion is a [SoundEffect](../../../../frb/docs/index.php). This can be created by adding a [.wav file](../../../../frb/docs/index.php) to the FlatRedBall Editor.

```csharp
AudioManager.Play(Explosion);
```

If volume is not specified, then Play uses the [MasterSoundVolume](mastersoundvolume.md).

Sounds can be played with a custom volume:

```csharp
// Values are 0 - 1, so .5 is 50%
float volume = .5f;
AudioManager.Play(EngineNoise, volume);
```
