# CollideAgainstMove

### Introduction

The CollideAgainstMove method performs the following:

* Returns true if a collision has occurred.
* Repositions the calling Circle and/or the argument object depending on the argument masses.

**Note:** All collision methods, including CollideAgainstMove, are common to all Shapes. If you came here through a link on a page beside the Circle (such as Polygon), don't worry, the code for all shapes is identical.
