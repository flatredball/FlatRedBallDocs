# Save

### Introduction

The Save function is used to save a Section instance (and all of its contained sections) to an XML file. Saving a Section can be helpful in a number of situations:

* To save a snapshot of performance before making changes so that the effectiveness of the changes can be measured
* To send a file to another developer for assistance in improving performance
* To save a file from a device (such as Android or iOS) for viewing on a PC

### Saving on Android

The following code can be used to save on Android:

```csharp
string path;
path = Android.OS.Environment.ExternalStorageDirectory.AbsolutePath;
string fileName = System.IO.Path.Combine(path, "Sections.xml");
mSection.Save(fileName);
```

This saves to the following folder:

```
/storage/emulated/0/Sections.xml
```

This file can be accessed using the FS File Explorer app on Android.
