# Introduction

Entity instantiation in Glue projects is standardized. The constructor appears in Generated code. The standardization of constructors enables the following:

* Every Entity is instantiated the same way, making Entity instantiation in custom code easy
* Generated code can instantiate any Entity allow for factory and addition of Entities inside other Entities and Screens in Glue.

For information on how to instantiate Entities, see [the following tutorial](/broken/pages/rViT6t7JgWJj1juIjptq).
