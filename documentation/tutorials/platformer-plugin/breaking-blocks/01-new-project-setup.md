## Introduction

We'll begin this tutorial with an empty project. Mine will be called BreakingBlocksProject.

## Glue Wizard

The Glue Wizard can help us get a quick project set up. We will leave most of the options to their default, but we will change the following:

### Player Entity

-   Change **What kind of control will the player have?** to **Platformer**
-   Uncheck **Add Sprite to Player Entity** unless you intend to add graphics to your Player entity. This tutorial will not cover how to add graphics to the Player entity.

### Levels

-   Change **Number of levels to create** to **1**. We will only have one level in this game

## Conclusion

Now our project is ready to go and we can start adding our level.
